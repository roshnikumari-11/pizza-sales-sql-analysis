# 🍕 Pizza Sales SQL Analysis Project

This project is a complete **SQL data analysis case study** based on a pizza sales dataset. It was completed by following a YouTube tutorial and involves solving various business questions using SQL. The dataset was provided in CSV format and imported into a MySQL database for analysis.

##  Project Overview

In this project, I performed SQL-based analysis on a pizza sales dataset to answer real-world business questions related to revenue, popularity, timing, and pizza categories. 

Each SQL query solution is documented with a **screenshot** of the result, compiled in a **Canva presentation** (PDF format).

##  Dataset

- The dataset was provided in **CSV format** with the following files:
  - `orders.csv`
  - `order_details.csv`
  - `pizzas.csv`
  - `pizza_types.csv`

##  Tech Stack

- **MySQL**
- **MySQL Workbench**
- **Canva** (for the final presentation with screenshots)

##   Questions Solved

###  Basic Level

-  Retrieve the total number of orders placed  
-  Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales  
-  Identify the highest-priced pizza  
-  Identify the most commonly ordered pizza size  
-  List the top 5 most popular pizza types, along with their corresponding quantities  

###  Intermediate Level

-  Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered  
-  Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day  
-  Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas  
-  Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day  
-  Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue
